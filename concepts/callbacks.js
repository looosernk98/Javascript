// definition : when a function is passed into another function as an argument , it is called a callback function which
//              is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

// When to Use a Callback?
// Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a
//  file to load).

// In the real world, callbacks are most often used with asynchronous functions. example : setTimeout() and setInterval()
