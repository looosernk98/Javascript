// A script that updates/adds new functions is called “polyfill”. It “fills in” the gap and adds missing implementations

/*
For example, Math.trunc(n) is a function that “cuts off” the decimal part of a number, e.g Math.trunc(1.23) returns 1.

In some (very outdated) JavaScript engines, there’s no Math.trunc, so such code will fail.
*/

if (!Math.trunc) { // if no such function
    // implement it
    Math.trunc = function(number) {
      // Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
      // they are covered later in the tutorial
      return number < 0 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number);
    };
  }

/* how to make our modern code work on older engines that don’t understand recent features yet?

There are two tools for that:

1. Transpilers.
2. Polyfills.
